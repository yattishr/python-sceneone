# python-sceneone

This project implements a creative director agent named "SceneOne_Director" that generates ad scripts for products. The agent can adopt different personas or "vibes" to create scripts in various styles.

## Features

*   **Dynamic Personas**: The agent can switch between different "vibes" like "Hype" and "Tech" to alter its creative direction.
*   **Script Generation**: It can generate short, impactful ad scripts for products.
*   **Script Saving**: The agent can save the generated scripts to text files.
*   **Powered by Gemini**: The agent uses Google's Gemini model for its natural language generation capabilities.

## How to Use

1.  **Set up the environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2.  **Run the agent**:
    (Instructions on how to run the agent would go here. This part is not yet clear from the provided files.)
    ### Execute the ADK WEB from the command line.
    adk web .

## Example Output

Here is an example of a script generated by the agent for a "Volkano Bluetooth Speaker":

```
PRODUCT: Volkano Bluetooth Speaker
--- SCRIPT ---
Look, don't just hear the music, feel it. The Volkano speaker drops pure, unadulterated sound with a style that speaks volumes. It's compact. It's iconic. Turn up the vibe.
```
